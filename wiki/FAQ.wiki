Here are some issues you may encounter when using JOpenID.

= How to specify realm =

The realm must start with `http://` or `https://`. For example:

manager.setRealm("http://www.example.com");
manager.setRealm("http://*.example.com");

The importance is that, the Identifier of an end user (returned by OP) is different if the realm changes. For example:

|| *Realm* || *Identifier* ||
|| http://www.example.com || http://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=ABC ||
|| http://*.example.com || http://www.google.com/accounts/o8/id?id=XYZ ||

If your web site has sub-domains such as `bbs.example.com`, `blog.example.com`, etc., we 
strongly recommend you specify the realm as `http://*.example.com` to make all domains share one identifier.

= How to debug on local machine =

Assume that you have own the domain `example.com`, and to debug the web application you can simply add one line in your `hosts` file:

{{{
www.example.com 127.0.0.1
}}}

Then you can debug on local machine.

The file `hosts` is under `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc` in Windows, and `/etc/hosts` in Linux/UNIX.

= I saw some web sites allow users enter their emails to locate the OP sign on page =
